        <h2 data-animate>The Core Principle</h2>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.1">
          In physics, an object with momentum tends to keep moving. The heavier it is and
          the faster it's going, the harder it is to stop. This principle applies directly
          to marketing programs.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.15">
          A marketing program with momentum—established brand recognition, growing word of
          mouth, compounding content assets—becomes easier to sustain and harder for
          competitors to disrupt. Every dollar invested yields more than the last.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.2">
          A program without momentum requires constant force just to maintain position.
          Every dollar invested yields less than the last because you're fighting inertia.
        </p>

        <h2 data-animate>How to Recognize Momentum</h2>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.1">
          Marketing momentum shows up in your metrics, but you have to know where to look:
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.15">
          <strong>Positive momentum indicators:</strong> Declining CAC over time. Increasing
          organic traffic share. Rising brand search volume. Shorter sales cycles. Higher
          close rates. More inbound vs. outbound pipeline. Content that generates leads
          months after publication.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.2">
          <strong>Negative momentum indicators:</strong> Rising CAC despite consistent spend.
          Increasing dependence on paid channels. Flat or declining brand search. Longer
          sales cycles. "We need more leads" as a constant refrain despite increasing spend.
        </p>

        <h2 data-animate>Building Momentum</h2>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.1">
          You can't buy momentum directly. You can only create conditions for it to develop:
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.15">
          <strong>Invest in mass before velocity.</strong> Market position (your "mass")
          amplifies everything else. A strong brand, clear positioning, and established
          trust make every campaign more effective. Investing in velocity (more campaigns,
          more content, more spend) without mass just burns energy.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.2">
          <strong>Compound, don't campaign.</strong> One-off campaigns create spikes, not
          momentum. Build assets that compound: content that ranks and continues to drive
          traffic, communities that grow through network effects, partnerships that expand
          your reach over time.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.25">
          <strong>Reduce friction.</strong> Momentum and friction are opposing forces.
          Every point of friction in your funnel dissipates momentum. A 10% improvement
          in conversion rate often beats a 10% increase in top-of-funnel spend.
        </p>

        <h2 data-animate>The Inflection Point</h2>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.1">
          Momentum has a critical threshold. Below it, every dollar of reduced investment
          causes disproportionate decline. Above it, the system becomes self-sustaining.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.15">
          This is why the "should we scale marketing spend?" question is often wrong. The
          right question is: "Have we achieved escape velocity?" Scaling spend before you
          have momentum just burns cash faster. Scaling after you have it compounds your
          advantage.
        </p>

        <h2 data-animate>Diagnostic Questions</h2>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.1">
          When evaluating your marketing momentum, ask:
        </p>
        <ul data-animate data-animate-delay="0.15">
          <li>Is our CAC trending down over time, or up?</li>
          <li>What percentage of pipeline comes from organic vs. paid sources?</li>
          <li>How much of our content generates leads 6+ months after publication?</li>
          <li>Are our sales cycles getting shorter or longer?</li>
          <li>Would reducing marketing spend by 20% reduce results by more or less than 20%?</li>
        </ul>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.2">
          The last question is the most revealing. If a 20% cut causes more than 20% decline,
          you don't have momentum—you have a treadmill.
        </p>
