        <h2 data-animate>The Core Principle</h2>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.1">
          In physics, friction is the force that opposes motion. When you push an object
          across a surface, friction converts kinetic energy into heat—energy that's lost
          from the system, unable to do useful work.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.15">
          Marketing friction works the same way. Every unnecessary form field, every
          complicated pricing page, every unclear next step converts interested prospects
          into lost opportunities. That energy doesn't just disappear—it goes to your
          competitors.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.2">
          But here's what most people miss: friction isn't just about losing individual
          leads. It's about training the market. Every person who bounces from your
          complicated demo request form doesn't just leave—they form an impression.
          They tell their peers. They remember.
        </p>

        <h2 data-animate>Where Friction Hides</h2>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.1">
          The obvious friction points are easy to spot: long forms, confusing navigation,
          slow page loads. But friction accumulates in less visible places:
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.15">
          <strong>Cognitive friction:</strong> Messaging that requires too much work to
          understand. Value propositions that aren't immediately clear. Pricing pages
          that need a spreadsheet to decode. Your prospect has to think harder than they
          want to.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.2">
          <strong>Process friction:</strong> The "we need to schedule a call to discuss
          your needs" when a pricing page would do. The "your sales rep will reach out
          within 24 hours" when they wanted an answer now. The seven-step buying process
          that made sense internally but baffles customers.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.25">
          <strong>Trust friction:</strong> The absence of social proof. The case studies
          that don't feature companies like theirs. The generic stock photos that signal
          "we're not confident enough to show you real people." Every missing trust signal
          is friction.
        </p>

        <h2 data-animate>The Compounding Problem</h2>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.1">
          Friction compounds. A 10% drop-off at each of five stages doesn't mean you lose
          50% of leads—it means you keep only 59%. Add a sixth stage and you're at 53%.
          The math is brutal:
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.15">
          <strong>5 stages at 90% conversion each:</strong> 0.9^5 = 59% survive<br />
          <strong>5 stages at 95% conversion each:</strong> 0.95^5 = 77% survive
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.2">
          That 5% improvement per stage nearly doubles the difference in final conversion.
          This is why reducing friction often beats increasing top-of-funnel: you're
          improving a multiplicative factor, not an additive one.
        </p>

        <h2 data-animate>Measuring Friction</h2>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.1">
          You can't manage friction you can't see. The standard funnel metrics help, but
          they don't tell the whole story:
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.15">
          <strong>Time-to-action metrics:</strong> How long between first visit and form
          fill? Between form fill and demo? Between demo and proposal? Longer times often
          indicate hidden friction.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.2">
          <strong>Drop-off concentration:</strong> Where do people leave? A high demo
          request rate but low demo completion rate suggests friction in your scheduling
          process, not your offer.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.25">
          <strong>Support ticket patterns:</strong> What do people ask before they buy?
          Questions about pricing, about how things work, about what's included—these are
          friction signals. If the question is common, the answer should be obvious.
        </p>

        <h2 data-animate>Reducing Friction</h2>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.1">
          The goal isn't zero friction—some qualification is valuable. The goal is
          intentional friction: every point of resistance should serve a purpose.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.15">
          <strong>Audit ruthlessly:</strong> Walk through your own funnel. Every step,
          click, form field, wait. Ask: does this serve the buyer or our internal process?
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.2">
          <strong>Measure against alternatives:</strong> Try your competitors' processes.
          How many clicks to understand their pricing? To talk to someone? To start a
          trial? If they're faster, that's friction you're creating.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.25">
          <strong>Ask the people who didn't buy:</strong> Exit surveys at form abandonment.
          Lost deal analysis that actually asks process questions, not just competitive ones.
        </p>

        <h2 data-animate>Diagnostic Questions</h2>
        <ul data-animate data-animate-delay="0.1">
          <li>How many steps between "interested" and "talking to sales"?</li>
          <li>Can someone understand your pricing without human help?</li>
          <li>What's the minimum commitment to see if you're a fit?</li>
          <li>Where in your funnel do you lose more than 25% between stages?</li>
          <li>What questions do prospects repeatedly ask that your site should answer?</li>
        </ul>
