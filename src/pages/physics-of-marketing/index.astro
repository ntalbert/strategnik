        The Physics of Marketing Investment
      </h1>
      <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-400 mb-6" data-animate-hero-sub>
        Marketing isn't art or science—it's engineering. The same laws that govern
        physical systems govern marketing systems.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body text-gray-400" data-animate data-animate-delay="0.6">
        This framework applies concepts from physics to explain why some marketing
        investments compound while others dissipate, and how to diagnose what's
        actually happening in your marketing system.

      <div class="prose-minimal">
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.1">
          After 20 years watching B2B SaaS companies make marketing investment decisions,
          I noticed patterns. The companies that broke out and the ones that stalled often
          had similar products, teams, and markets. The difference was usually in how they
          understood the forces acting on their marketing system.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.15">
          The physics metaphor emerged from trying to explain these patterns to CEOs and
          boards. When you frame marketing investment in terms of momentum, friction, and
          gravity, people suddenly see their situation differently.
