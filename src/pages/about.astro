        I build demand generation engines for companies at inflection points

      <p class="text-body-lg text-gray-400" data-animate-hero-sub>
        The moment when a growth-stage company's marketing investment either compounds into
        breakout success or stalls into expensive mediocrity—that's where I work.

        <h2 data-animate>The Pattern</h2>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.1">
          Over 20 years in enterprise SaaS, I've noticed something: the companies that break out
          and the ones that stall often have similar products, similar teams, similar TAMs. The
          difference is usually in how they approach marketing investment at critical moments.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.15">
          They either understand the physics of their situation—momentum, friction, gravity—and
          invest accordingly, or they don't. The ones who do tend to get acquired by companies
          like AOL, Amazon, and others. I've been fortunate to be part of several of those stories.
        </p>

        <h2 data-animate>The Work</h2>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.1">
          Most recently, I was VP of Marketing and Growth at BRIA AI, where I built significant
          pipeline through partner-sourced leads from AWS, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm. Before that, I
          led demand generation at Quartile and Certent, always focused on the same challenge:
          building marketing systems that create predictable, scalable pipeline.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.15">
          My background spans adtech, martech, and B2B SaaS. I've worked both sides—agency and
          in-house—and I've seen what works at every stage from seed to scale.
        </p>

        <h2 data-animate>The Framework</h2>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.1">
          Along the way, I developed what I call the "Physics of Marketing Investment"—a framework
          for understanding why some marketing investments compound while others dissipate. It
          applies concepts from physics (momentum, friction, gravity, acceleration) to explain
          marketing dynamics in ways that help leaders make better investment decisions.
        </p>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.15">
          I'm turning this framework into a book, but in the meantime, I'm sharing pieces of it
          here and working with companies who want to apply it.
        </p>

        <h2 data-animate>The Person</h2>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.1">
          Missouri native, Drury University graduate, now based in Sacramento with my wife Kerry
          and our kid Knox. I believe in Midwestern directness, clear thinking, and marketing that
          actually works rather than marketing that sounds impressive in board meetings.
        </p>

        <h2 data-animate>Get in Touch</h2>
        <p data-animate data-animate-delay="0.1">
          If you're at an inflection point and want to think through your marketing investment
          strategy, I'd be happy to talk.
