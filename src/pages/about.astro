        <h2>The Pattern</h2>
        <p>
          Over 20 years in enterprise SaaS, I've noticed something: the companies that break out 
          and the ones that stall often have similar products, similar teams, similar TAMs. The 
          difference is usually in how they approach marketing investment at critical moments.
        </p>
        <p>
          They either understand the physics of their situation—momentum, friction, gravity—and 
          invest accordingly, or they don't. The ones who do tend to get acquired by companies 
          like AOL, Amazon, and others. I've been fortunate to be part of several of those stories.
        </p>

        <h2>The Work</h2>
        <p>
          Most recently, I was VP of Marketing and Growth at BRIA AI, where I built significant 
          pipeline through partner-sourced leads from AWS, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm. Before that, I 
          led demand generation at Quartile and Certent, always focused on the same challenge: 
          building marketing systems that create predictable, scalable pipeline.
        </p>
        <p>
          My background spans adtech, martech, and B2B SaaS. I've worked both sides—agency and 
          in-house—and I've seen what works at every stage from seed to scale.
        </p>

        <h2>The Framework</h2>
        <p>
          Along the way, I developed what I call the "Physics of Marketing Investment"—a framework 
          for understanding why some marketing investments compound while others dissipate. It 
          applies concepts from physics (momentum, friction, gravity, acceleration) to explain 
          marketing dynamics in ways that help leaders make better investment decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm turning this framework into a book, but in the meantime, I'm sharing pieces of it 
          here and working with companies who want to apply it.
        </p>

        <h2>The Person</h2>
        <p>
          Missouri native, Drury University graduate, now based in Sacramento with my wife Kerry 
          and our kid Knox. I believe in Midwestern directness, clear thinking, and marketing that 
          actually works rather than marketing that sounds impressive in board meetings.
        </p>

        <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
        <p>
          If you're at an inflection point and want to think through your marketing investment 
          strategy, I'd be happy to talk.
