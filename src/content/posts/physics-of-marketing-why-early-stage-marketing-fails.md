I've spent twenty years on the marketing side of the fence—leading growth at B2B SaaS companies from seed stage through acquisition, including roles at companies later acquired by Amazon and AOL. I've been the marketing leader who gets hired to build a pipeline. I've observed peers being replaced after 12 months. I've sat in the rooms where those decisions get made.

And for a long time, I accepted the standard explanations. The marketing leader couldn't get CEO alignment. Positioning was muddled. They were great at the last stage but not this one. Or the more generous version: there's such a thing as being the right leader for a certain stage, and the skills that got the company from Point A to Point B aren't the skills that get it from B to C. Different stages demand different people.

Then I started paying attention to what was happening on the other side of the fence. The sales leaders were churning even faster. The VP of Sales would cycle out; the next one would inherit the same pipeline challenges, and within a year, the pattern would repeat. Same conversations, same frustrations, same outcome. Two different functions, same curve.

That's when the individual explanations stopped making sense to me. These weren't just talent problems or fit problems. The pattern was structural. And it looked a lot like a physics problem.

If you look at it that way—as a problem of mass, velocity, and measurable distance—something useful happens. You stop blaming the pilot and start reading the instrument panel. You stop swapping out the head of marketing and the head of sales as if they were interchangeable parts, and start asking whether the system itself can support the outcomes you're expecting. Most importantly, you open a path to something that's been in chronically short supply between GTM leaders and the rest of the management team: trust.

## A Well-Documented Problem with a Shallow Explanation

On the marketing side, the most rigorous data comes from Spencer Stuart's annual CMO Tenure Study, which has tracked the role for nearly twenty years. Their 2023 findings: Fortune 500 CMO average tenure is 4.2 years, slightly below the 4.6-year C-suite average. At the top 100 U.S. advertisers, it drops to 3.1 years—the lowest since 2009. Three out of four CMOs at those top advertisers were holding the position for the first time.

On the sales side, the data is even more stark. Bravado's research reports that the average tenure of the first VP of Sales at a Series A SaaS startup is just seven months. The typical company cycles through three VPs of Sales in the first eighteen months. Seven months. That's barely enough time to complete a full sales cycle at most B2B companies, let alone build a repeatable process.

These numbers have generated considerable analysis. Marketing Brew and Marketing Week have extensively covered the CMO trend. MIT Sloan Management Review argued that short tenure isn't always a failure signal. Yuval Ben-Itzhak tracked the pattern and polled executives on causes: absence of a clear strategy topped the list at 40%, followed by conflict with sales and CEO misalignment. GTM Magazine explored whether the long-tenure GTM leader is a thing of the past.

All of this work is worth reading. But it shares a common framework: it treats tenure as a function of the person—their skills, their alignment ability, their stage appropriateness—or as a function of organizational dynamics between functions.

What pushed me past those explanations was what I kept seeing from the marketing side: the sales leader next to me was living the same story. Same structural constraints, same unrealistic timelines, same outcome—just faster, because they were closer to the revenue number. Two different functions, same curve. If this were really about individual talent or stage-fit, you'd expect more variation between the two roles. Instead, they move in lockstep. That points to something deeper than the people in the seats.

## The Data Gap That Hides the Real Pattern

Spencer Stuart covers Fortune 500 companies and top advertisers. Bravado covers early-stage sales hires. Nobody has published a comprehensive, cross-functional view of GTM leader tenure by company funding stage. That's a significant blind spot.

The table below presents my estimate, triangulated from enterprise data, anecdotal startup observations, and Bravado VP Sales data. I've included confidence levels because I'd rather be transparent about what's estimated than present a clean chart that overstates its certainty.

| Stage | Marketing | Sales | Confidence |
|-------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Seed | 12–18 mo | 6–12 mo | Low — inferred |
| Series A | 18–24 mo | 7–18 mo | Low — Bravado + anecdotal |
| Series B | 2–3 years | 18 mo–2.5 yr | Medium — bridging sources |
| Series C+ | 3–4 years | 2.5–3.5 yr | Medium — nearing enterprise |
| Fortune 500 | 4.2 years | 3.5–4 yr | High — Spencer Stuart |

Two things stand out. First, tenure increases in near-lockstep with company maturity across both functions. Second, sales leaders churn faster than marketing leaders at every stage—likely because they're closer to the revenue number and face consequences sooner when the system can't produce. But both functions follow the same curve.

If this were primarily a talent problem—wrong hires, wrong stage-fit—you'd expect more variation between companies and between functions. Instead, the pattern is remarkably consistent. That consistency points to something structural.

## A Structural Explanation

Consider what a Seed or Series A company actually looks like from a GTM perspective. Almost nobody knows who you are. You have minimal market presence—no installed base, few case studies, and negligible word-of-mouth. Your touchpoints with the market are narrow: maybe one or two channels producing anything meaningful on the marketing side, a handful of active deals on the sales side. And the big question—how far away is self-sustaining, repeatable revenue?—is genuinely unanswerable.

Now drop a marketing leader and a sales leader into that environment and give them a venture-backed timeline.

The problem isn't that these people lack skill. It's that the system lacks sufficient mass to respond predictably to inputs. On the marketing side, every campaign is a high-variance experiment. A play that would reliably generate pipeline at a Series C company—where brand recognition opens doors and multiple channels create compound effects—may produce nothing at Series A, because the underlying system can't support it yet. On the sales side, every deal is a custom effort. Without inbound momentum, case studies, or market credibility to lean on, the sales leader is building each opportunity from scratch in a market that doesn't know the company exists.

The same force applied to a heavier object produces a different result than when applied to a lighter one. That's not a metaphor. That's how GTM investment actually works.

And here's the variable everyone misses: at early stages, nobody knows how far away repeatable revenue actually is. Not the CEO, not the board, not the marketing leader, not the head of sales. You can't calculate the distance when you don't have enough data to build the model. All you can know is whether you're pointed in a good direction and building momentum. That uncertainty isn't a failure of leadership. It's a feature of the system at that stage.

## The Replacement Trap

When growth stalls at an early-stage company, the instinct is to replace the most visible person in the revenue equation. Usually, that's the head of sales first—they're closest to the number. When the next sales leader also stalls, the head of marketing is blamed for pipeline quality. Sometimes, both get replaced in the same cycle.

The new leaders inherit a system that's only marginally different. The company has a bit more market presence—the first team's work didn't vanish. Some channels have been tested. Some deals have been won or lost, generating data. But the underlying structure hasn't fundamentally changed. If the company still lacks sufficient market weight, if the touchpoints remain too narrow, if the distance to repeatable revenue remains unknowable, the new team faces the same constraints. And they face them at the added cost of lost institutional knowledge, reset relationships, broken handoff processes, and depleted morale across both functions.

The first GTM team's most valuable contribution may have been the data they generated—what messaging resonates, which channels produce, what the real sales cycle looks like, where the market responds, and where it's silent. That's the raw material the next phase needs. But companies rarely frame it that way. They frame it as a failed hire. Or two.

As companies mature through funding stages, this dynamic shifts. By Series B, there's real market presence, multiple channels producing a signal, and a clearer sense of the growth trajectory. The system has enough accumulated weight to respond more predictably. The marketing and sales motions begin to compound on one another rather than operate in parallel. Course corrections get smaller and less existential. Tenure lengthens across both functions—not because the leaders are necessarily more talented, but because the system has become more legible.

## What This Means for the People Making These Decisions

If the tenure pattern is driven more by structure than by talent, it changes how everyone should approach the GTM leadership relationship—and it opens a path to something more productive than the current cycle of hire, blame, replace, repeat.

**For founders and boards:** Your first GTM leaders are explorers, not optimizers. Their job is to generate the market presence and data that makes the next phase possible. The most valuable output they produce may be a clear map of what doesn't work, which dramatically reduces the cost of the next iteration. Measuring the head of marketing on pipeline and the head of sales on closed revenue in the first year may be measuring the wrong variables. If you frame these roles correctly and set expectations that match the actual physics of the system, you'll keep better people longer—and the ones you keep will trust you enough to tell you what's really happening instead of what you want to hear.

**For GTM leaders—marketing and sales:** Understand the structural reality before you accept the role. How much market presence exists? How many channels have real data? Is there a functioning handoff between marketing and sales, or are you building that from zero? How realistic are the revenue expectations given those constraints? If the company has near-zero awareness and expects a hockey-stick pipeline or a 3x ramp in two quarters, that's not an execution challenge. It's a structural constraint no hire can overcome. Negotiate expectations that reflect the system you're inheriting—and use the physics to explain why.

**For both:** The real prize here isn't just longer tenure. It's trust. When GTM leaders and the rest of the management team share a structural understanding of what's achievable at each stage—when marketing, sales, and the board are reading the same instrument panel—they stop finger-pointing and start solving the actual problem. That alignment is what turns a revolving door into a GTM engine.

This piece describes the pattern and offers a structural explanation for it. The natural follow-up: if this is a physics problem, is there a framework for navigating it—one that marketing leaders, sales leaders, and boards can actually use together?

I've been developing one for several years. It reframes GTM investment in terms of the same forces described here. It gives everyone at the table a shared language for setting expectations, measuring progress, and building the kind of trust that keeps good people in the seat long enough to deliver. More on that soon.
