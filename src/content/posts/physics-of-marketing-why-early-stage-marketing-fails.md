The VP of Sales lasted seven months. The head of marketing made it to fourteen. The replacements did about the same. By the time the company raised its Series B, it had cycled through three sales leaders and two marketing leaders—and the pipeline problem hadn't changed.

If you've been in B2B SaaS long enough, that story isn't surprising. It's Tuesday. And the explanations are always the same: the marketing leader couldn't get CEO alignment. The sales leader missed quota. Positioning was muddled. Or the more generous version: there's such a thing as being the right leader for a certain stage, and the skills that got the company from Point A to Point B aren't the skills that get it from B to C. Different stages demand different people.

I've spent twenty years on the marketing side of the fence—including roles at companies later acquired by Amazon and AOL—and for a long time, I accepted those explanations. Then I started paying attention to what was happening on the other side of the fence. The sales leaders were churning even faster. The VP of Sales would cycle out, the next one would inherit the same pipeline challenges, and within a year, the pattern would repeat. Same conversations, same frustrations, same outcome. Two different functions, same curve.

That's when the individual explanations stopped making sense to me. These weren't just talent problems or fit problems. The pattern was structural. And it looked a lot like a physics problem.

If you look at it that way—as a problem of mass, velocity, and measurable distance—something useful happens. You stop blaming the pilot and start reading the instrument panel. You stop swapping out the head of marketing and the head of sales as if they were interchangeable parts, and start asking whether the system itself can support the outcomes you're expecting. Most importantly, you open a path to something that's been in chronically short supply between GTM leaders and the rest of the management team: trust.

## A Well-Documented Problem with a Shallow Explanation

![Placeholder: GTM leader tenure data visualization](/images/posts/placeholder-tenure-data.jpg)

On the marketing side, the most rigorous data comes from [Spencer Stuart's annual CMO Tenure Study](https://www.spencerstuart.com/research-and-insight/cmo-tenure-study-2023), which has tracked the role for nearly twenty years. Their 2023 findings: Fortune 500 CMO average tenure is 4.2 years, slightly below the 4.6-year C-suite average. At the top 100 U.S. advertisers, it drops to 3.1 years—the lowest since 2009. Three out of four CMOs at those top advertisers were holding the position for the first time.

On the sales side, the data is even more stark. [Bravado's research](https://bravado.co/war-room/posts/startup-vp-sales-tenure) finds that the average first VP of Sales at a Series A SaaS startup is just seven months. The typical company cycles through three VPs of Sales in the first eighteen months. Seven months. That's barely enough time to complete a full sales cycle at most B2B companies, let alone build a repeatable process.

These numbers have been picked apart from every angle. [Marketing Brew](https://www.marketingbrew.com/), [Marketing Week](https://www.marketingweek.com/), [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/), [Yuval Ben-Itzhak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuvalb/), and [GTM Magazine](https://www.gtmnow.com/) have all taken a crack at explaining the pattern. The explanations range from CEO misalignment to sales conflict to the argument that short tenure isn't always a failure signal—sometimes it's a sign of promotion or role evolution.

All of this work is worth reading. But it shares a common frame: it treats tenure as a function of the person—their skills, their alignment ability, their stage-appropriateness—or as a function of organizational dynamics between functions.

What pushed me past those explanations was what I kept seeing from the marketing side: the sales leader next to me was living the same story. Same structural constraints, same unrealistic timelines, same outcome—just faster, because they were closer to the revenue number. Two different functions, same curve. If this were really about individual talent or stage-fit, you'd expect more variation between the two roles. Instead, they move in lockstep. That points to something deeper than the people in the seats.

## The Data Gap That Hides the Real Pattern

![Placeholder: Data gap illustration - funding stages](/images/posts/placeholder-data-gap.jpg)

Spencer Stuart covers Fortune 500 companies and top advertisers. Bravado covers early-stage sales hires. Nobody has published a comprehensive, cross-functional view of GTM leader tenure by company funding stage. That's a significant blind spot.

The table below is my estimate, triangulated from the enterprise data, anecdotal startup observations, and the Bravado VP Sales data. I've included confidence levels because I'd rather be transparent about what's estimated than present a clean chart that overstates its certainty.

| Stage | Marketing | Sales | Confidence |
|-------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Seed | 12–18 mo | 6–12 mo | Low — inferred |
| Series A | 18–24 mo | 7–18 mo | Low — Bravado + anecdotal |
| Series B | 2–3 years | 18 mo–2.5 yr | Medium — bridging sources |
| Series C+ | 3–4 years | 2.5–3.5 yr | Medium — nearing enterprise |
| Fortune 500 | 4.2 years | 3.5–4 yr | High — Spencer Stuart |

These numbers are estimates, and I want to be careful not to overclaim from my own table. But the directional pattern matches what I've observed over two decades and across multiple companies: tenure tends to increase with company maturity, and sales leaders tend to churn faster—probably because they're closer to the revenue number and face consequences first when the system can't deliver.

What I find harder to explain with a talent argument is the consistency across functions. If this were primarily about wrong hires or wrong stage-fit, you'd expect the marketing and sales patterns to diverge—different skills, different failure modes, different timelines. Instead, from the marketing side, I kept watching the sales leader next to me live the same story at the same pace. That's what made me think the problem might be structural.

## Why the Same Playbook Produces Different Results

![Placeholder: Physics of mass and velocity in GTM](/images/posts/placeholder-physics-playbook.jpg)

Consider what a Seed or Series A company actually looks like from a GTM perspective. Almost nobody knows who you are. You have minimal market presence—no installed base, few case studies, negligible word of mouth. You have very few levers to pull: maybe one or two channels on the marketing side, a handful of active deals on the sales side. And the big question—how far away is self-sustaining, repeatable revenue?—is genuinely unanswerable.

Now drop a marketing leader and a sales leader into that environment and give them a venture-backed timeline.

The problem isn't that these people lack skill. It's that the system is too light to hold a steady trajectory. In physics, applying force to a light object doesn't produce smooth, directed movement—it produces erratic, disproportionate swings. That's exactly what early-stage GTM looks like. A campaign that would generate a steady, predictable pipeline at a Series C company produces wildly inconsistent results at Series A—not because the strategy is wrong, but because there isn't enough mass in the system to dampen the variance. One good quarter looks like genius. One bad quarter looks like incompetence. Both are noise.

Meanwhile, the surface-area problem compounds the problem. With only one or two channels producing anything, GTM leaders have almost no levers to pull. Less surface area means less control. At a Series C company, if one channel underperforms, you shift investment to three others while you diagnose the problem. At Series A, if your primary channel stalls, you're grounded. There's nowhere to redirect. On the sales side, it's the same dynamic—without inbound momentum, case studies, or market credibility, every deal is a custom effort built from scratch in a market that doesn't know you exist. There's no leverage in the system.

And here's the variable everyone misses: at early stages, nobody knows how far away repeatable revenue actually is. Not the CEO, not the board, not the marketing leader, not the head of sales. You can't calculate the distance when you don't have enough data to build the model. You can't pace the effort when you can't see how far you need to go. All you can know is whether you're headed in the right direction and building momentum. That uncertainty isn't a failure of leadership. It's a feature of the system at that stage.

## The Replacement Trap

![Placeholder: Revolving door of GTM leaders](/images/posts/placeholder-replacement-trap.jpg)

When growth stalls at an early-stage company, the instinct is to replace the most visible person in the revenue equation. Usually, that's the head of sales first—they're closest to the number. When the next sales leader stumbles, the head of marketing is also blamed for the quality of the pipeline. Sometimes, both get replaced in the same cycle.

The new leaders inherit a system that's only marginally heavier. The company has a bit more market presence—the first team's work didn't vanish. Some channels have been tested. Some deals have been won or lost, generating data. But the underlying structure hasn't fundamentally changed. If the system is still too light to hold a trajectory, if the levers are still too few to provide real control, if the distance to repeatable revenue is still unknowable—the new team faces the same constraints. And they face them at the added cost of lost institutional knowledge, reset relationships, broken handoff processes, and depleted morale across both functions.

The first GTM team's most valuable contribution may have been the data they generated—what messaging resonates, which channels produce, what the real sales cycle looks like, where the market responds, and where it's silent. That's the raw material the next phase needs. But companies rarely frame it that way. They frame it as a failed hire. Or two.

As companies mature through funding stages, this dynamic shifts. By Series B, there's real market presence—the system has gained mass. Multiple channels are producing signals, giving GTM leaders more levers and control. The distance to repeatable revenue becomes measurable. The marketing and sales motions start compounding on each other instead of operating in parallel. The system is heavy enough to hold a trajectory, so course corrections get smaller and less existential. Tenure lengthens across both functions—not because the leaders are necessarily more talented, but because the system has become more controllable.

## The Goals That Would Have Saved the Last Three Hires

![Placeholder: Stage-appropriate goals framework](/images/posts/placeholder-goals-framework.jpg)

If the tenure pattern is structural, then the goaling has to be structural too. You can't set the same expectations for a GTM team operating in a light, low-control system as you would for one with real mass and multiple compounding channels. The goals need to reflect what's actually measurable and meaningful at each stage—and what builds toward the next one.

### Seed and Series A: Orientation and Signal

The system doesn't have enough mass to produce predictable revenue outcomes yet. Pipeline targets set from a fundraising model aren't goals—they're hopes. What the GTM team can produce at this stage is something more valuable than early revenue: signal. Which ICPs actually engage? Which ones convert, and at what velocity? Which channels produce real conversations versus noise? What does the actual sales cycle look like—not the one in the pitch deck, but the one in the CRM?

Expect 3–6 months to instrument the basics—CRM hygiene, attribution, lead scoring, ICP definitions—before these metrics produce reliable signal. That tooling-up period isn't wasted time. It's the foundation. Trying to measure before the instrumentation exists creates the illusion of data while producing noise.

| Metric | What It Measures | Minimum Viable Signal |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| ICP Signal Quality | % of qualified conversations with target buyers vs. off-ICP conversations | Trackable by month 4–6 |
| Learning Velocity | Time from campaign/channel launch to statistically meaningful signal; should shorten each iteration | Comparable by month 6+ |
| Channel Viability | Number of channels producing real engagement vs. still in test; trend over time | Initial read by month 3–4 |
| Pipeline Trend Direction | MoM acceleration or deceleration of qualified pipeline within target ICP segments (not absolute volume) | Meaningful by month 6+ |
| Sales Cycle Baseline | Actual observed sales cycle length vs. assumed, tracked by ICP segment | Requires 2–3 closed cycles |
| Win/Loss Patterns | Win rate by ICP segment, categorized loss reasons, product-market fit signal from real conversations | Useful at 15–20+ opportunities |

These aren't soft metrics. They're the leading indicators that determine whether revenue can happen at scale. A GTM team that delivers clear, improving signal on ICP fit, channel viability, and sales cycle reality in the first year has done the job—even if the absolute pipeline number doesn't match the board deck. That data is what makes the next phase possible.

### Series B and Beyond: Compounding What Works

The system has gained enough mass to hold a trajectory and enough levers to provide real control. You know your ICPs. You have channels with real conversion history. The sales cycle is documented, not assumed. The goals shift from signal to scale—compounding the motions already at work and improving the machine's efficiency.

The tooling infrastructure should already be in place from the prior stage. If it isn't—if a new GTM leader inherits a Series B company with Seed-stage instrumentation—expect 60–90 days to close the gap before these metrics are trustworthy. That's a red flag worth surfacing in the interview process.

| Metric | What It Measures | Expected Cadence |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Pipeline Volume & Velocity | Qualified pipeline generated and sped through stages, against proven ICP segments | Monthly reporting |
| Stage Conversion Rates | Conversion % at each funnel stage identifies where the system loses momentum | Monthly reporting |
| CAC Payback | Customer acquisition cost relative to first-year revenue; tracked by segment and channel | Quarterly; stable by Q2–Q3 |
| Marketing—Sales Compound Rate | The degree to which the marketing-sourced pipeline converts at higher rates or shorter cycles than outbound-only | Quarterly comparison |
| Expansion Revenue | Net revenue retention; upsell/cross-sell from installed base as an indicator of product-market depth | Quarterly reporting |
| ICP Penetration | % of total addressable accounts in target segments reached, engaged, or converted | Quarterly; tracks ceiling |

The critical difference between these first two stages isn't ambition—it's the relationship between inputs and outputs. At Series B, the system has sufficient mass and levers that the inputs have a known, measurable relationship to the results. Course corrections are adjustments, not pivots.

### Series C and Beyond: Efficiency, Expansion, and Market Position

By Series C, the GTM system has significant mass. Brand presence is established. Multiple channels are being produced at scale. The sales motion is documented and repeatable. The distance to self-sustaining revenue isn't a mystery—you're either there or you can see the trajectory clearly. The physics challenge shifts: the system is no longer too light to control. The risk is that it becomes too heavy to move efficiently. Bloated spend, channel fatigue, slowing growth rates masked by absolute revenue numbers, and organizational complexity that creates drag on every motion.

The goal at this stage reflects that shift. The question isn't "are we building momentum?" or "are we compounding what works?"—it's "are we extracting maximum return from the mass we've built, expanding into adjacent segments, and defending the position we've earned?"

Infrastructure should be mature. If a new GTM leader inherits a Series C+ company and the instrumentation still has gaps, that's a 30–45 day diagnostic and remediation exercise—and it tells you something important about what the previous team prioritized.

| Metric | What It Measures | Expected Cadence |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| GTM Efficiency Ratio | Total GTM spend as % of new ARR; trend over time should improve as mass compounds | Quarterly; board-level |
| Channel ROI by Maturity | Return per channel segmented by established vs. emerging; identifies diminishing returns in mature channels and investment case for new ones | Quarterly review |
| Segment Expansion Rate | Revenue and pipeline growth from adjacent ICP segments beyond the original beachhead; measures whether the company is expanding its addressable market | Quarterly; tracks growth ceiling |
| Brand-Sourced Pipeline % | % of pipeline originating from inbound, direct, or organic channels attributable to brand presence rather than paid acquisition | Monthly, trend matters most |
| Net Revenue Retention | Expansion + renewal revenue minus churn from installed base; the clearest measure of product-market depth at scale | Monthly; board-level |
| Competitive Win Rate | Win rate in deals where a named competitor was present; tracked by segment and competitor; measures market position defensibility | Quarterly; requires CRM discipline |
| GTM Velocity Ratio | Pipeline velocity relative to team size and spend; measures whether scaling the team is producing proportional or diminishing returns | Quarterly; flags scaling drag |

At this stage, the physics question isn't whether the system can produce results—it clearly can. The question is whether the system is getting heavier faster than it's getting stronger. GTM efficiency ratio and velocity ratio are the two metrics that answer that directly. If both are trending favorably, the mass is working in your favor. If efficiency is degrading while velocity stalls, you've got a system that's accumulating weight without accumulating power—and that's a structural problem no amount of pipeline activity will solve.

And the physics don't stop evolving at Series C. From late-stage through IPO and beyond, the variables keep shifting. Mass continues to grow, but the composition changes—brand equity, installed base, and market expectations all become heavier, and the system becomes harder to redirect. Strategic pivots that were possible at Series B become enormously expensive. Surface area expands into new dimensions: international markets, new product lines, partner ecosystems, analyst and investor relations. Each new lever adds control but also adds complexity—more channels to maintain, more stakeholders to coordinate, more signals to parse. Distance transforms entirely. Pre-IPO, the target shifts from repeatable revenue to provable unit economics and growth predictability that satisfy public market scrutiny. Post-IPO, the distance metric resets to quarterly expectations set by analysts and investors—a cadence the GTM engine was never originally built for. The mass that carried you through growth stages can become inertia if the system isn't continually re-tuned for each new definition of what "self-sustaining" means.

**The practical implication for founders and boards:** Stage-appropriate goaling isn't about lowering the bar. It's about measuring the variables that actually predict future revenue at each phase. If your Series A GTM team is producing a clear, accelerating signal on ICP fit and channel viability, that's a team building a foundation. If they're producing a vanity pipeline against an unvalidated ICP, that's activity masquerading as progress—and no amount of leader replacement will fix it. Use the tables above as a starting point for the conversation, not a ceiling.

**The practical implication for GTM leaders:** Negotiate these expectations before you accept the role. Walk into the interview with a stage-appropriate view of what you'll measure and why—and how long it will take to instrument. Show the board that you understand the difference between momentum toward repeatable revenue and premature revenue theater. A founder who sees that you know how to set goals that match the system's actual physics is a founder who will give you the time to deliver—and trust what you report back.

**For both:** The real prize isn't just longer tenure. It's alignment. When GTM leaders and the board are oriented around the same stage-appropriate metrics—when marketing, sales, and leadership are reading the same instrument panel—they stop finger-pointing and start solving the actual problem. That shared understanding is what turns a revolving door into a GTM engine.

---

Remember the company at the top of this piece? Three sales leaders, two marketing leaders, pipeline problem unchanged. If you looked at each of those departures individually, you'd find a plausible explanation for every one. Wrong skills. Bad timing. Misalignment with the CEO. But zoom out and the explanation is simpler: the system was too light to hold a trajectory, too narrow to control, and too early to measure against outcomes it couldn't yet produce. Every replacement resets the clock without changing the physics.

The next time you're in a room where someone says, "We need to upgrade the GTM leader," ask one question first: has the system changed, or are we just changing the person? If the mass, the surface area, and the distance look the same as they did twelve months ago, you already know what's going to happen.

That's the diagnosis. The natural follow-up: if this is a physics problem, is there a framework for navigating it—one that marketing leaders, sales leaders, and boards can actually use together?

I've been developing one for several years. It reframes GTM investment around the same forces described here and gives everyone at the table a shared language for setting expectations, measuring progress, and building the kind of trust that keeps good people in the seat long enough to deliver. More on that soon.
