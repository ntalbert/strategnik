*This is Part 1 of a series on Marketing Physics—a framework for understanding why go-to-market efforts succeed or fail based on principles borrowed from the physical sciences.*

A Series A company hires its first marketer. Three months pass with modest results. Six months in, the board grows restless. By month nine, the marketer is gone and the search begins anew.

I've watched this cycle repeat at every stage of my career—across adtech, martech, and enterprise SaaS. The pattern is so consistent you could set a clock by it. And nearly every time, the diagnosis is the same: "We hired the wrong person."

The diagnosis is almost always wrong. The problem isn't the marketer. It's that founders, boards, and even experienced CMOs are operating with a flawed mental model of how markets actually respond to new entrants.

## Markets Are Physical Systems

Founders tend to treat marketing like a light switch—off during the building phase, on when capital arrives. But markets don't behave like electrical circuits. They behave like physical systems, governed by thresholds, mass, and momentum.

This isn't a loose metaphor. It's a framework I call Marketing Physics, and it explains—with uncomfortable precision—why most early-stage marketing efforts produce nothing, and why the few that work share specific structural characteristics.

The first principle is activation energy.

## The Activation Energy Problem

In chemistry, activation energy is the minimum energy required to initiate a reaction. Drop a lit match on a pile of timber and nothing happens. The match burns out. The wood stays wood. But apply enough sustained heat to cross the threshold, and you get a self-sustaining fire.

Marketing works the same way. A new company starts with zero brand mass—no awareness, no credibility, no accumulated presence. It exists in a state of commercial invisibility. And moving from invisible to visible requires crossing a threshold that scattered, intermittent effort will never reach.

Here's what this looks like in practice: a startup spends moderately across several channels for a few months. Each individual effort is reasonable. But because the investment is spread thin and inconsistent, the signal never accumulates. Each dollar of marketing spend decays before the next one arrives. The cumulative effect is zero—not because the tactics were wrong, but because the energy never reached the threshold required to trigger a reaction.

This isn't a failure of execution. It's thermodynamics.

## Why the Threshold Exists

Think about your own behavior as a buyer. The first time you encounter a new B2B vendor, you do nothing. You're busy. They're unknown. Maybe weeks later you see them at a conference. Then their content appears in your feed. A colleague mentions them in passing. After four or five touchpoints spread across months, something shifts: *these people might be legitimate.*

That's the activation energy requirement for a single person. Now multiply it across an entire addressable market.

The implication is straightforward but routinely ignored: below a certain concentration of effort in a given channel, marketing spend doesn't underperform. It produces nothing. There's no partial credit. You either cross the threshold or you don't.

This is why the "let's try a little of everything" approach—some LinkedIn posts, a conference or two, a smattering of paid ads, maybe a webinar—is the most expensive possible strategy. Not because any individual tactic is wrong, but because dividing energy across five channels guarantees you cross the activation energy threshold in none of them.

## The Board Meeting Problem

Here's where this framework becomes directly relevant to how companies are governed.

The typical board cadence creates almost perfect conditions for never crossing the activation energy threshold. A new marketing leader joins. The board expects measurable results within a quarter or two. When results don't materialize—and they won't, because the threshold hasn't been crossed—pressure mounts to change strategy.

So the company pivots. New channels. New messaging. New agency. And the clock resets to zero.

Every strategic pivot before the threshold is crossed doesn't just waste the current quarter's spend. It wastes everything that came before it. The accumulated energy dissipates. You're back to dropping matches on cold timber.

The companies I've seen break through this cycle share one characteristic: someone with enough organizational authority held the line through the dead zone—that painful period between months two and eight where consistent effort produces almost no visible results, but where the invisible accumulation is actually happening.

That person is usually a founder, a board member, or a CMO with enough credibility to say: "I know this looks like it's not working. Stay the course."

## What Brand Mass Looks Like

When the activation energy threshold is crossed, you can feel it. I think of this next concept as brand mass—the accumulated market presence that begins generating its own momentum.

At low brand mass, everything requires force. Cold outreach gets ignored. Content earns no organic reach. Conference conversations start with "So what do you guys do?" Every interaction is uphill.

When brand mass reaches a meaningful level, the dynamics shift. Inbound interest appears without paid support. Prospects recognize your name during outbound. Recruiting gets easier. Content gets shared by people outside your immediate network. You're no longer pushing a boulder. The boulder is starting to roll on its own.

This shift tends to happen when recognition in your target segment reaches somewhere around 15–20%. Not fame. Not dominance. Just enough accumulated presence that your go-to-market efforts face meaningfully less friction.

Getting there requires what most organizations find hardest to sustain: consistent, concentrated effort in a focused set of channels, maintained through a period where the results don't yet justify the investment.

## The Compounding Paradox

The cruel math of early-stage marketing is that the effort-to-results curve is deeply nonlinear.

Months one through three produce almost nothing visible. Months four through six produce slightly more than nothing. The inflection point—where effort starts compounding into momentum—typically arrives between months six and twelve. But only if you've maintained consistent presence without resetting.

Companies that stay consistent through the dead zone hit an inflection point. Companies that change course every quarter never do—regardless of how much they spend in total. I've seen this pattern repeat across enough companies that I'm convinced the variable isn't budget, talent, or tactics. It's consistency through the dead zone.

This is deeply counterintuitive for data-driven operators. The rational response to six months of flat results is to change the approach. But in a system governed by activation energy thresholds, changing the approach is the one thing guaranteed to prevent breakthrough.

## What This Means in Practice

I'm not arguing for blind faith in failing strategies. There's a difference between a strategy that hasn't yet reached threshold and a strategy that's fundamentally misconceived. The diagnostic question is: *are we seeing leading indicators of accumulation, even if lagging indicators haven't moved?*

Leading indicators of accumulation look like: gradually increasing engagement rates on content, qualitative feedback shifting from "who are you?" to "I've seen you around," warm responses to outbound increasing even without closed deals, website direct traffic growing slowly.

If those signals are present, you're likely in the dead zone—pre-threshold but accumulating. Hold the line.

If those signals are completely absent after six months of concentrated effort, your thesis about the market or message is probably wrong, and that's a different problem that deserves a different response.

## Why This Matters Now

In the current environment—tighter funding, longer sales cycles, boards demanding capital efficiency—the activation energy problem is more acute than ever. There's less margin for the try-everything-and-see approach. Every wasted quarter of scattered effort is a quarter of runway burned without accumulation.

The companies that will build durable market positions from here are the ones that understand marketing as a physical system: choose where to concentrate, commit to the threshold timeline, and resist the organizational pressure to reset before the reaction ignites.

Physics doesn't care about your board's patience. It cares about whether you applied enough concentrated energy, in the right place, for long enough.
