Every growth-stage company faces the same question: when do we step on the gas?

Too early, and you burn cash on an engine that isn't ready. Too late, and you miss the window.

This is the inflection point problem.

## What Is an Inflection Point?

In mathematics, an inflection point is where a curve changes from concave to convex—where the rate of change itself changes.

In marketing, it's the moment when incremental investment starts yielding exponential returns.

Before the inflection point, you're building. After it, you're scaling.

## Recognizing the Signs

Inflection points don't announce themselves. But they leave clues:

**Leading indicators:**
- Conversion rates stabilize above target
- CAC payback period hits acceptable range
- Win rates against specific competitors improve
- Sales cycle duration decreases
- Inbound-to-outbound ratio shifts

**Lagging indicators:**
- Pipeline coverage consistently above 3x
- Marketing-sourced revenue percentage stable
- Customer acquisition costs trending down
- Expansion revenue growing

The key word is *consistent*. One good month isn't an inflection point. Three quarters of improving metrics might be.

## The Premature Scale Trap

Most companies scale too early. The pattern is predictable:

1. Raise funding
2. Hire aggressively
3. Increase marketing spend 3-5x
4. Watch efficiency collapse
5. Cut back, retrench, restart

This happens because external pressure (investors, boards, growth targets) pushes for scale before the engine is ready.

## The Missed Window Trap

Fewer companies scale too late, but it happens. Usually because:

- Leadership is traumatized from previous premature scaling
- Finance maintains conservative spend limits too long
- The team mistakes efficiency for readiness
- Competitors move first

Missing the window can be worse than moving early. Markets consolidate. Buyers make decisions. Category leaders emerge.

## The Framework

Here's how I think about inflection point readiness:

### Foundation Layer
- Product-market fit is clear (not assumed)
- ICP is defined and validated
- Basic funnel mechanics work
- Unit economics make sense at current scale

### Efficiency Layer
- CAC is at or below target
- Conversion rates are stable
- Sales can handle current volume
- Customer success isn't drowning

### Scalability Layer
- Channels have headroom (not maxed out)
- Team can absorb growth
- Systems can handle 3x volume
- Playbooks are documented

You need all three layers before you scale. Missing one is a recipe for expensive lessons.

## The Decision

When you see the inflection point, you have a choice:

**Conservative path**: Increase spend 50-100%. Test scaling. Validate that efficiency holds. Scale further.

**Aggressive path**: Increase spend 200-300%. Accept that efficiency will dip temporarily. Bet on capturing market position.

Neither is wrong. The right choice depends on:
- Competitive dynamics (is the window closing?)
- Capital availability (can you afford the aggressive bet?)
- Team capacity (can you execute at speed?)
- Market timing (is this the moment?)

## The Courage Part

Here's what they don't tell you: recognizing the inflection point is easier than acting on it.

Pouring fuel on the fire means accepting risk. Efficiency will likely dip before it improves. Some bets won't pay off. You'll spend money that feels uncomfortable.

But the companies that break out—the ones that go from $10M to $50M to $100M—are the ones that recognize their inflection point and have the courage to act.

The physics of marketing say that objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Your job is to know when the motion is ready for acceleration.
